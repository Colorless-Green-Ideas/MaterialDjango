       * configured with the element as the `resolveConflict` property. The

       * document that was attempted to be created or updated, and the error
       * that was received by the error handler (which will implicitly always
       * have status code 409). The resolver should return a `Promise` that
       * resolves or rejects with the outcome of the conflict resolution.
       *
       * If no `resolveConflict` property is available, the element will request
       * conflict resolution strategies by notifying of the conflict with a
       * `app-pouchdb-conflict` event. The event detail has a `resolveConflict`
       * method that can be called to pass a handler with the same signature as
       * described above. The last conflict resolver obtained in this fashion by
       * the time event propagation completes will be the one used.
       *
       * If no conflict resolver is obtained, then the error is re-thrown.
       *
       * @param {string} method The method to attempt in a conflict-aware
       * fashion, such as "put" or "post".
       * @param {Object} doc The document to perform the method with.
       * @return {Promise} A promise that resolves or rejects with the outcome
       * of the conflict-aware transaction.
