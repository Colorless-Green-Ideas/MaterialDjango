# app-elements

The app elements are a loosely-coupled set of components that can be useful when building entire applications. They include components for features like routing, internationalization, data storage, and more.

*What happened to the `carbon` elements?*

If you've been following the Polymer project, you might have been familiar with the working name for these proposed application-level components: the `carbon-elements`.  We received lots of feedback that new Polymer developers found the periodic table naming scheme confusing, so with this new product line of components we wanted to be as clear and straightforward as possible with the naming.
